# Project 1 Blog Post 

In this project I read in data from the NHL API, created some variables, created some contingency tables and numerical summaries, and also created some graphs. 

I would not blindly try code not knowing whether it will work or not. Always have a reference. 

The most difficult part was uploading to github. Second hardest was making it so the names convert to teamID's. 

My take aways for future projects are to budget more time.
