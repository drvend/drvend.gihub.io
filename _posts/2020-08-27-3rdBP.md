### Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites). What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  
I really like the help() functionality for the functions in R. I use these frequently and it tells you the exact syntax you need for the function. At this point I definitely prefer SAS becasue it seems more structured and less ambiguous or multiple ways to do things. 

### What parts do you miss about your other language?  Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)
In SAS there were less multiple ways to do things. I did not think R was a difficult language to learn when I was doing datacamp courses before this class but now it seems much harder. This may be a function of the difficulty of the class though. I also think SAS has more descriptive error messages that help you fix your problem.
