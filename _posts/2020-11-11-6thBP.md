### what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?
My initial answer was pretty concise and I think it still reflects what a data scientist is well: 

"I think being a data scientist is about using computing and statistical tools to derive valuable insights from data and communicate those insights so they can be used effectively."

### What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
I like R as a tool becasue it is very easy to create shiny app's and dashboards that can help you share and communicate your analysis. I do not like how there are a lot of different methods and syntax to do the same thing. Overall, I do like it more than SAS, which is the only other programming language I know. I will probably use whatever language is most appropriate for the problem, or whichever language is standard at the company I join. If I had a choice, I would probably choose R. 

### what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
I am not going to do anything differently, but I will incoroporate the new tools and methods I have learned to complete tasks and solve problems.
