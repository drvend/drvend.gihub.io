What would I do differently? 
Probably more exploratory data analysis, and more playing with model parameters and maybe compare more models, if I had more time. 

What was the most difficult part for you? 
Using the parameters to create reports for each day of the week. I still don't have a complete understanding of how it works, but I understand the generally. 

What are your big take aways from this project? 
That you can basically us parameters as a type of macro function. I thought the way to do this in R was the function() function, but now I have learned more functionality for creating multiple reports at one time, not just running code on different data sets without retyping it.
